# WhatsApp-Wine

Out Of The Box [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) Installer for Linux using [Wine](https://winehq.org/)

---

### Why?
Simple. My friends want to try Linux for first time and it's too hard to understand Wine and manually configure everything. So, I made this simple script to help everyone that have trouble installing WhatsApp on Linux without any port or from your web browser.

### üìñ Installing Prerequisites
- Ubuntu
  - [Wine Stable](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu)
  - p7zip-rar (`sudo apt install p7zip-rar`)
  - winetricks (`sudo apt install winetricks`)
- Fedora
  - [Wine Stable](https://wiki.winehq.org/Fedora)
  - p7zip-rar (`sudo dnf install p7zip`)

### üñäÔ∏èNote

- I'm not sure if on other Linux distributions works
- I tested this script on Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 32 and OpenSUSE Leap 15.2
- I made it to work the best on Ubuntu 20.04, in the future maybe I will make it for other distributions.
